# CS316-compilers-lab

The purpose of this project is to build a compiler that can translate the source code of programs written in MICRO language into executable code.

## PA1 
Build a scanner `microLexer.l` that will take an input file and output a list of all the tokens in the program.

## PA2
Build a Parser `microParser.y` for the MICRO language upon the scanner `microLexer.l` built in PA1

## PA3
Build the symbol table(s) for MICRO input programs.

## PA4
Generating assembly code for `assignment statements`, `expressions`, `READ` and `WRITE` commands, and `if` statements.

## PA5
Generating assembly code for the `WHILE` loop, which could have `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` statements.

## PA6
Generating assembly code for the multiple `functions`.

## PA7
Register allocation with 4 registers
